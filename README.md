# Counter app

The goal of this project is to study and discuss MVC architectural pattern implementation in an Android app.

The main reason is: developers say (no reference for now) it doesn't fit with the Android architecture and components so I really want to understand it.

## Counter app's specifications
+ must keep a count
+ can add x (where x is an integer) to the count
+ can remove x (where x is an integer) from the count
+ can reset the count
+ can't add or remove from the count more than the allowed

## TODO
I'll change the app's specifications to turn it a bit more complex (with lists of counts, persistence, etc.) to make the project and the study more complete and reliable.
